Genesis flood narrative
Main article: Genesis flood narrative
The Genesis flood narrative is encompassed within chapters 6â€“9 
in the Book of Genesis, in the Bible.[6] The narrative indicates
 that God intended to return the Earth to its pre-Creation state 
 of watery chaos by flooding the Earth because of humanity's misdeeds
  and then remake it using the microcosm of Noah's ark. Thus, the 
  flood was no ordinary overflow but a reversal of Creation.[7] 
  The narrative discusses the evil of mankind that moved God to 
  destroy the world by way of the flood, the preparation of the ark for certain animals, Noah, and his family, and God's guarantee (the Noahic Covenant) for the continued existence of life under the promise that he would never send another flood.[8]
