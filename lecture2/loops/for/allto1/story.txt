"Hansel and Gretel" (/ˈhænsəl, ˈhɛn- ... ˈɡrɛtəl/; German: Hänsel und Gretel [ˈhɛnzl̩ ʔʊnt ˈɡʁeːtl̩])[a] is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm and published in 1812 as part of Grimms' Fairy Tales (KHM 15).[1][2] It is also known as Little Step Brother and Little Step Sister.

Hansel and Gretel are siblings who are abandoned in a forest and fall into the hands of a witch who lives in a bread,[3] cake, and sugar house. The witch, who has cannibalistic intentions, intends to fatten Hansel before eventually eating him. However, Gretel saves her brother by pushing the witch into her own oven, killing her, and escaping with the witch's treasure.[4]

Set in medieval Germany, "Hansel and Gretel" has been adapted into various media, including the opera Hänsel und Gretel by Engelbert Humperdinck, which was first performed in 1893.[5][6]

Genesis flood narrative
Main article: Genesis flood narrative
The Genesis flood narrative is encompassed within chapters 6–9 
in the Book of Genesis, in the Bible.[6] The narrative indicates
 that God intended to return the Earth to its pre-Creation state 
 of watery chaos by flooding the Earth because of humanity's misdeeds
  and then remake it using the microcosm of Noah's ark. Thus, the 
  flood was no ordinary overflow but a reversal of Creation.[7] 
  The narrative discusses the evil of mankind that moved God to 
  destroy the world by way of the flood, the preparation of the ark for certain animals, Noah, and his family, and God's guarantee (the Noahic Covenant) for the continued existence of life under the promise that he would never send another flood.[8]file3.txt\n
